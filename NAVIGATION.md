# Enhanced Navigation System - Team Pulse Dashboard

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Previous Issue**: Users were confused about workflow navigation. When a Team Lead assigned work to a member, there was no clear way to navigate to that specific member's dashboard to monitor their progress.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive navigation system with member detail pages and enhanced user flow.
